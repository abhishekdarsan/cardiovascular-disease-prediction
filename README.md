# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction 

This project predicts the risk of death from heart failure using real clinical records and a logistic regression model. The dataset is from a real-world heart failure study.

# ðŸ“Š Dataset
- [Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records)
- 299 records
- 13 features including age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, etc.

#  Model Used
- Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
- StandardScaler for normalization
- Confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score for evaluation

# Key Steps
- Data preprocessing (missing check, scaling)
- Train-test split
- Model training and prediction
- Performance evaluation
- Feature importance visualization
- Confusion matrix heatmap

# Results
- Accuracy: ~75â€“85% (varies by run)
- Precision, Recall, F1-score: Detailed in classification report
- Most important features: Ejection fraction, serum creatinine, time

#  Visualizations
- Feature importance plot
- Confusion matrix heatmap
